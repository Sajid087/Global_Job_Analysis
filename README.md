# Global Job Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring job market trends worldwide. The project uses a dataset of global jobs to derive insights and visualizations on key topics such as demand, skills, salaries, and location-based trends.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze job data to uncover global trends in the workforce.
- Provide insights into which industries, skills, and locations are in high demand.
- Create visualizations and summaries for easy understanding.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key insights on job roles, skills, locations, and salaries.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs to make trends more accessible.
- **Insights**: Recommendations and highlights from the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
